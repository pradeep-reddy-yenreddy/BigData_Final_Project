    "False Negative (FN):\n",
    "Scenario 1: A False Negative occurs when the model predicts that a customer will not subscribe to a deposit, but they actually do. In this case, the bank misses out on a potential subscription, leading to lost revenue opportunities and the inability to nurture the customer relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2: Another False Negative scenario is when the model fails to identify a customer likely to subscribe. If these customers are not targeted with promotional offers or personalized communication, the bank may lose market share to competitors who successfully engage with these customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "True Positive (TP):\n",
    "Scenario 1: A True Positive occurs when the model correctly predicts that a customer will subscribe to a deposit, allowing the bank to tailor marketing efforts and financial products to these customers effectively. This targeted approach can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2: Another True Positive scenario is when the model accurately predicts successful subscriptions. With this insight, the bank can analyze the characteristics of these customers, enabling the development of more appealing products and services for similar prospects, thereby boosting overall revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "True Negative (TN):\n",
    "Scenario 1: A True Negative occurs when the model correctly predicts that a customer will not subscribe to a deposit, allowing the bank to focus resources on other areas of the business. For example, the bank can allocate marketing budgets to other campaigns or customer segments with higher subscription potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2: Another True Negative scenario is when the model accurately identifies customers who are unlikely to subscribe. By avoiding unnecessary promotional activities with these customers, the bank can optimize marketing expenses and improve the efficiency of their campaigns.\n",

    "\n",
    "Understanding these scenarios helps the bank in making strategic decisions, optimizing marketing campaigns, and maximizing the return on investment in their marketing efforts.\n",
